# Dots and Boxes



## Rules
You move by connecting two dots with a horizontal or vertical line. When you
place the last 'wall' of a single box, the box and its contents are yours.
The players move in turn but whenever a player takes a box they must move again.

The game ends when all the boxes have been taken.
